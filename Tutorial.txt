Hello Hello Welcome to the Git Task

Hash: Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a hash
Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same. Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well. Git can therefore tell what information needs to be saved where by comparing hashes rather than comparing entire files.

Pull:The term pull is used to receive data from GitHub. It fetches and merges changes from the remote server to your working directory. The git pull command is used to pull a repository.

Pull request:Pull request allows you to announce a change made by you in the branch. Once a pull request is opened, you are allowed to converse and review the changes made by others. It allows reviewing commits before merging into the main branch.
Pull request is created when you committed a change in the GitHub project, and you want it to be reviewed by other members. You can commit the changes into a new branch or an existing branch.
Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your branch to add them to your existing pull request.
